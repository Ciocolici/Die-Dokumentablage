# Die Dokumentablage
A C# (CSharp) Console App exercise-project, done during my classes for IT Specialist in Application Development by Lutz & Grub Academy. A document storage simulator, giving the user the option to see information about a specific document.

*To run the Console App program directly, launch "Die Dokumentablage.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net6.0".*
